      <h1>Jalen's Portfolio</h1>
      
      <p>Welcome to my Portfolio!</p>
      
      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p> My name is Jalen Jenkins and I am currently a Computer Science Major in Cornell University's Class
          of 2023. Although I have only been coding since August of 2019, I feel as though I have learned a
          ton since starting. I am working here from home in Charlotte, North Carolina, and I am incredibly
          excited to take in everything Google has to offer! <br><br>Born and raised in Charlotte, North Carolina, 
          I've always been a curious person. When I was younger, I had a passion for science, so my parents
          pushed me in the premed direction. It was not until January of 2019 when I came to the realization that
          pursuing medicine would not satisfy me in life! I then realized that I valued my time and freedom,
          which prompted me to pursue a career that would allow me to have both: Entrepreneurship! I now look for
          opportunities to have multiple streams of income. <br><br> </p>
